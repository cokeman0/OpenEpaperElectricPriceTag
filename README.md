It shows a 12 hour graf, of the electric price, generated by HA and using "Energi Data Service"

Just uploaded a Nordpool edition, just remember to replace "sensor.nordpool_kwh_dk1_dkk_3_10_025", with your nordpool sensor in the automation trigger and in configuration variable.

In configuration variables you can also add surcharges (both fixed and as percentage) to better reflect your real price. Use 100 as priceMultiplicator if you want to show prices as Ã¶re/cents instead of whole monetary units. You can set the number of decimal places as you wish.

You can also set graphLowestMaximum which is the lowest maximum value the graph will use, to give better indication of extremely low prices.

Top Row: Date/time, current price, Max, min price (Within the 12 hour window)

And when data is not available, it will show this:
